- Check filenames are valid before running build
- Remove empty scenes from scene list before building
- Change scene add/remove to dynamically modify unity build settings scene list (instead of on build)

- Play button (run OS-matching version)
- Build+Zip, Build+Upload, Build+Zip+Upload
- Find a way to build html + include warning that user has to set up on itch page after push
- Add active scene(s) button
- Reorder scene list
- Verify scene names
- Get name from Metadata (read only) 
- Save defaults :itch username and other shared options
- Github integration (separate package?)

- Guess reasonable defaults for executable and itch channel name based on
  project name (but don't overwrite changes!)
